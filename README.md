# prime_generator_v1

Simple prime list generator.
Good practice for me to learn how to design GUIs and practice a little bit of number theory.

Not very polished, but I wanted to put something out. I have identified 3 potential places I would like to clean up.
1. If given the input of a prime number, that number is not counted in the output, only primes less than the input.
2. When given input twice without restarting, it would be nice to clear the output block so it is easier to read.
3. Have a way to raise errors for bad input (such as putting in letters).
